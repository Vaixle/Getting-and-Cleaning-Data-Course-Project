# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset 
2. Read   files
3. Merge files
3. Keeping only those columns which
   reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Converts the `activity`  columns into factor
5. Edit columnNames
6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `tidydata.txt`.
